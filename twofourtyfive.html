          <b>WELCOME TO PHILLY,</b> one of the most beautiful and historic cities in the United States. Since you'll be here for a while, you might as well take a look around at what the city has to offer.
          Everyone knows Philadelphia has some really cool museums, like the Art Museum with the Rocky steps, and those other ones. Here's a definitive guide to making the most of your museum exploration time in Philly.

        <h2><u>Which Museums Are Good</u></h2>
        <p>Using Tripadvisor data, here are all of the top rated museums displayed by location with an indicator of what type of museum it is. Size is logarithmic since some, like the Museum of Art, simply have a much larger online presence than those with only 10s of reviews and without a logarithmic size display the map is nearly meaningless (other than to locate the few largest museums):</p>

        <h2><u>Which Museums Look Good</u></h2>
        <p>
          So you don't have time to actually go to the museums and like learn history or appreciate art or whatever people do at museums, but you still want people to know you went to a museum. Fear not, we've got the definitive numbers for museum-Insta bang for buck. Here's 15 of the most hashtagged museums:
        </p>
        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 1280px; height: 667px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='100%' height='500px' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fprod-useast-a.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;dataprojectone' /><param name='name' value='dataproj1&#47;PostsbyMuseumHashtags' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>
        <p>
          It's cool to know where most people are going for their #coolmuseumsnaps, but which museums give the best results? I scraped over 10000 posts (see methodology section for source data if you're curious) and compared the number of likes on a user's museum posts to the average number of likes on all their other posts, here's the ordering of how museum Insta posts stack up:
        </p>
        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 1280px; height: 667px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='100%' height='500px' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fprod-useast-a.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;dataprojectone' /><param name='name' value='dataproj1&#47;AveragePostPopularityComparison' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>
        <p>
          With an average of -1.950 likes on average compared to other posts on a user's accounts, it turns out people might not like endless museum snaps cluttering their feed! Moreover, a standard deviation of 6.792 implies even more heavily that there's no real link between likes and going to museums at all. We can also pretty clearly see that there's no correlation between the number of posts at a location and the number of likes it gets relative to its peers. Does this look any better when we segment by museum type?
        </p>
        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 1280px; height: 667px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='100%' height='500px' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fprod-useast-a.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;dataprojectone' /><param name='name' value='dataproj1&#47;MuseumTypevsPostPopularity' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>
        <p>
          There's a little more clustering here, but really the only thing we learn is something we already knew: art posts can be hit or miss and history posts tend to be scroll-past-able. There's hope for the more niche categories, like science or specialty museums, so be sure to look head to some of the smaller and different shaped marks on the Tripadvisor map!
